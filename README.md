Welcome to the My 'Projects' repository! This repository contains three exciting machine learning projects, each focusing on predictive modeling in different domains. Below are the details of each project along with the datasets required for implementation.

You can just simply copy the block or the whole code and pasted into your system. then modify the dataset's Location in the code after downloading the dataset needed for the project. Just run it!

### 1. Movie Rating Prediction
- Description: This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, and actors. By employing regression techniques, we analyze historical movie data to create a model that accurately estimates user ratings.
- Features:
  - Data collection from sources like IMDb and Kaggle.
  - Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and feature engineering.
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns.
  - Implementation of regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
- Dataset: The dataset includes details such as movie name, year, duration, genre, rating, votes, director, and main actors(taken from Kaggle website).

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction
- **Description**: This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various characteristics such as age, gender, class, and fare. The goal is to build a classification model that can effectively distinguish between survivors and non-survivors.
- **Key Features**:
  - Data preprocessing to clean and prepare the dataset.
  - Feature selection to identify significant predictors of survival.
  - Model training using algorithms like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
- **Dataset**: The Titanic dataset contains information about passengers including their demographics and survival status(taken from Kaggle website).

### 3. Sales Prediction
- **Description**: This project aims to forecast sales for a retail business based on historical sales data and various influencing factors such as promotions and seasonality. The objective is to develop a predictive model that helps businesses optimize inventory and marketing strategies.
- **Key Features**:
  - Time series analysis to understand sales trends over time.
  - Feature engineering to incorporate external factors affecting sales.
  - Model evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
- **Dataset**: The sales dataset includes historical sales records along with promotional activities and seasonal indicators(taken from Kaggle website).
